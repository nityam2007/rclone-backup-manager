            🚀 **Update: Enhanced Tray & Settings**

            ## New Features
            - ⬇️ **Minimize to Tray**: Dedicated button in Backup tab and robust tray integration.
            - 🚀 **Start Minimized**: Option to start the application silently in the tray.
            - 🔒 **Single Instance**: Prevents multiple instances from running simultaneously.
            - ⚙️ **Configurable Settings**: Dry Run and Auto-Run settings now persist in the Config tab.
            - 🖱️ **Scrolling Support**: Mouse wheel scrolling for backup lists and dialogs.

            ## Improvements
            - 🎨 **UI Consistency**: Unified dialog styling with modern theme.
            - 🐛 **Bug Fixes**: Resolved startup errors and tray behavior on Linux.
